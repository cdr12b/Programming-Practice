# Interview Questions for Cloud System Engineer

## 1. What is cloud computing?
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet, allowing for on-demand access to a shared pool of configurable resources such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics.

## 2. What are the different types of cloud services?
- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: Offers hardware and software tools over the internet, typically for application development.
- **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis.

## 3. What are the deployment models of cloud computing?
- **Public Cloud**: Services are delivered over the public internet and shared across multiple organizations.
- **Private Cloud**: Services are maintained on a private network for a single organization.
- **Hybrid Cloud**: Combines public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them.

## 4. What is virtualization in cloud computing?
Virtualization is the process of creating a virtual version of a resource, such as a server, storage device, or network, allowing multiple virtual instances to run on a single physical hardware system.

## 5. What is the difference between horizontal and vertical scaling?
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Involves adding more machines or instances to handle increased load.
- **Vertical Scaling**: Involves adding more power (CPU, RAM) to an existing machine.

## 6. What are some common cloud security challenges?
- Data breaches
- Account hijacking
- Insecure APIs
- Denial of Service (DoS) attacks

## 7. What is a Content Delivery Network (CDN)?
A CDN is a network of servers distributed geographically that work together to provide fast delivery of internet content by caching it closer to users.

## 8. Explain the concept of multi-tenancy.
Multi-tenancy is an architecture where a single instance of a software application serves multiple tenants (customers), with each tenant's data isolated and invisible to others.

## 9. What is serverless computing?
Serverless computing allows developers to build and run applications without managing the underlying infrastructure, automatically scaling resources based on demand.

## 10. How do you ensure high availability in cloud applications?
High availability can be ensured through strategies such as load balancing, redundancy, failover mechanisms, and using multiple availability zones or regions.
